### About 

Bookish is a sample library app that allows me to search through my favorite books with Algolia's Search API and Instant Search widget. Bookish is built on React and utilizes styling from Semantic UI.

## To Use

1. Fork and clone this respository, run npm install, and then npm start.
2. Search for an author, book title or genre!
